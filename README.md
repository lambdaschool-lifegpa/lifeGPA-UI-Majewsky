# LIFEGPA

[Visit Product](http://lifegpa.saschamajewsky.de)

LIFEGPA is a webapp that has been built during the WEB20 buildweek_1 (20.05.2019-24.05.2019) by [LambdaSchool](https://lambdaschool.com/) students. Each student fulfills a role in the project to collectively build the app.

The application allows a user to assess his life quality by several metrics and check it with a single GPA so he can find out what areas in life he might improve upon to become happier.
